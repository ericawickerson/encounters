# Encounters: the coincidence of space, time, and subjectivity

> An interdisciplinary conference, 16-18 September 2019, St John's College, Cambridge, UK.

This conference will bring into dialogue a range of disciplines to explore ways in which space and time interact, how they are socially formed or experienced, how they are culturally represented, and what this may say about subjectivity and perceptions of identity.

The conference offers an exciting opportunity for encounters between geographers, historians, philosophers, anthropologists, and literary and cultural critics, among others, to discuss questions relating to mobility, migration, globalisation, identity perception and performance (including on social media platforms), and the transmission of experience in culture and memory, both collectively and individually.

All human experience is situated in time and space but considering what this actually means for each of us as unique individuals is a much harder task and one that has occupied diverse theorists for millennia. It is possible to talk of clock time and of physical spaces, both of which give us a sense of measurability. But how does it actually feel to locate ourselves in a spatial and temporal world? How is it unique for each of us? How do spaces change over time? How can one space or one time have such different meaning for different people? What does this say about identity and subjectivity?
